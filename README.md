# Weather  App - Practice

## This is a Follow Along practice that I found on Youtube
This side project contains small amounts of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
Mainly used to help give myself a basic understanding of utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Features
* Users can type in a City that will fetch data via an EventListener to get weather data from the api
* Link to API: https://openweathermap.org/api


## TODO
Since this was a code along from a Youtube video, I have a few adjustments I want 
to implement on my own:

- A button that changes the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa
- Change the background to an image of the location fetched from Google Images
