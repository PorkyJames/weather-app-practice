# Weather  App - Practice

## This is a Follow Along practice that I found on Youtube
This side project contains small amounts of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
Mainly used to help give myself a basic understanding of utilizing HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Features
* Users can type in a City that will fetch data via an EventListener to get weather data from the api
* Link to API: https://openweathermap.org/api


## TODO
Since this was a code along from a Youtube video, I have a few adjustments I want 
to implement on my own:

- A button that changes the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa (Completed)

## What I've Learned
I am still incredibly inexperienced and this project honestly took a lot out of me even though I'm nearly complete with my bootcamp.
Learning is one thing, but implementing my own ideas is another. I had to refactor a ton of code and add additional functions to help separate my approach.
I relied on ChatGPT to help guide me in a direction when I wasn't able to advance forward. I hope to become less reliant on it and bemore creative 
in my approach to problem solving.
